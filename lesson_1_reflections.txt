How did viewing a diff between two version of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It clearly showed what was changed between the two versions.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can find bugs faster and more easily.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pros: You can commit exactly when it makes sense, cons: if you are prone to not saving, you will still not save often enough.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

They handle different kinds of files in different contexts. Git is optimized for programmers, where others are not.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log will show the whole commit history if you are in a git repository. If you want to compare two commits type git diff and the two commit ids to see differences between the two versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can always easily revert the changes
